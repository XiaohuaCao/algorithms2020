    "Topologicla Sort of a derected graph(a graph with undirectional edges) is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge(U, V) from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the ordering\n",
    "Basic of topological sorting\n",
    "1. Source: any node that has no incoming edge and has only outgoing edges is called source\n",
    "2. Sink: any node that has only incoming edges and no outgoing edge is called a sink\n",
    "3. Topological odering starts with one of the sources and ends at one of the sinks\n",
    "4. Topological ordering is possible only when teh graph has no directed cycles, if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). \n",
    "BFS: starts with all the sources, and save all sources to a sorted list. \n",
    "Then remove all sources and their edges from teh graph. After the removal, we will have new sources, so we will repeat process until all vertices are visited.\n",
    "(1) store the graph iin `Adjacency Lists`, each parent vertex will have a list containing all of its children. Use `HashMap`, key is parent vertex and value will be a list containing chldren vertices.\n",
    "(2) to find sources, we will keep `HashMap` to count the in-degree ie. count for incoming edges of each vertex. Any vertex with '0' in-degree will be a source\n"
